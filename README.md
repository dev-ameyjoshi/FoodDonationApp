## Problem
Food waste is becoming a growing
source of worry, owing to its detrimental influence on
the economy and agricultural business. According to
research, households in Finland appear to be the
largest producers of food waste, with some of this due
to food being discarded because it has expired. Food
waste has become a major issue today. It has become
a severe concern in our society in recent years,
affecting both the poor and the rich countries, even
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
estimates that over half of all food produced will
never be consumed. By squandering food, we waste
the "time and energy" that was used to make it, as
well as our "natural resources" which could have
been used in a more efficient and sustainable
manner. Waste also has a significant financial impact
and has an influence on the environment, including
overall greenhouse gas emissions. This applicationbased project assists in the collection of food from
contributors and distribution to those in need. This is
the project's fundamental and key goal
