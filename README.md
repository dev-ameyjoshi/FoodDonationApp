## Problem
One day, we came across a random thought in this random wedding invitation. When seeing all the elite people leaving their tables full of leftover foods, 
and meanwhile the beggars right outside the halls waited to get them. That's where the thought of developing an application for the leftover food 
(Android- IMPLEMENTED: Android) came.
The number of reasons it can be used:
1. Left overs from: Marriage halls/ home food/ restaurant chains etc 
2. Users: Could it be social welfare organizations/individual users (App's focus: Individual users)
3. Individual users here can be foreigners (who have no idea of local food markets) for travellers (nearby available food) or bachelors in search of food.
4. Food wastage management/save.
